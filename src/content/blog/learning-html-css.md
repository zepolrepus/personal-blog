This past week, I dove headfirst into HTML and CSS—and I've got to say, I'm both excited and a little overwhelmed. Below, I'll share some highlights, a few struggles, and a handy table showing how I tackled each day.

## Getting Started
I kicked things off by creating a super basic webpage. At first, my page was basically just a white screen with a heading and a sentence. Exciting, right? But the moment I *linked my first CSS file* and changed the background color... I felt like I unlocked a whole new universe.

> Even making a simple page look cool with basic styling can spark major motivation.

## What Surprised Me
- **HTML isn't “hard,”** but it's easy to get lost in the tags. You'll want to keep your structure organized from the start.  
- **CSS is powerful**, but learning about the box model made my head spin at first. Turns out, margins, borders, and padding can actually be fun once you get the hang of it.  
- **Positioning elements** is a bit like solving a puzzle. If your layout isn't cooperating, try stepping away for a bit and coming back with fresh eyes (or a coffee break).

## A Little Table of My Progress
Below is a quick rundown of what I focused on each day of my first week. It's not *super* detailed, but it'll give you a sense of how I paced things out.

| Day       | HTML Topic                                 | CSS Topic                  | Notes                                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | Basic tags: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`     | Inline styles              | Felt odd mixing styles with HTML, but it was good practice. |
| Tuesday   | Headings & paragraphs                      | External CSS w/ `<link>`   | Loved keeping my CSS separate. Much cleaner.              |
| Wednesday | Links & images                             | Fonts & typography         | Played with Google Fonts—so many options!                 |
| Thursday  | Lists & tables                             | The box model              | Understanding padding vs. margin was a game changer.       |
| Friday    | Divs & sections                            | Basic layout (float)       | Floats can be tricky—definitely some trial and error here. |
| Saturday  | Forms (text inputs, buttons)               | Flexbox basics             | Flexbox is *so* much easier to use than floats.            |
| Sunday    | Revision & mini-project                    | More practice on Flexbox   | Built a small demo page to test everything I learned.      |

## One Thing I'm Proud Of
I managed to build a tiny website for my personal notes. It only has a home page and a second page listing my to-do items, but it's fully styled! A small win, but it felt huge to me. Using `<div>`s and basic Flexbox properties, I was able to line up everything nicely.

Here's a snippet of code (it's simple, but it got me excited):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My Mini Site</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Paulina's Notes</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section class="notes">
      <h2>Today's Tasks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Finish reading CSS documentation</li>
        <li>Practice Flexbox</li>
        <li>Go hiking in the afternoon</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```

And guess what? It actually looked decent once I threw in some CSS for spacing and colors!

##What's Next?
In the coming days, I'm planning to dive deeper into responsive design. Making websites that look good on a phone, tablet, and desktop at the same time sounds like a challenge, but I'm ready for it.

If you're learning HTML & CSS too, keep experimenting! I discovered that the best way to learn is by building tiny projects—even if they're just for fun. You'll be amazed at how quickly you improve when you're actively creating something.

Alright, that's all for now. Thanks for reading, and I'll be back soon with more updates!
